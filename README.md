Hi, I'm Otis!

I'm a passionate developer interested in full-stack development, particularly fascinated by Y2K and alternative design aesthetics. I enjoy crafting beautiful and interactive websites using tools like Tailwind CSS and GSAP, and I'm equally enthusiastic about backend development.

Feel free to reach out!
